## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Authorization Methods
Each resource now implements comprehensive permission checks:
```php
public static function canViewAny(): bool
{
    return auth()->user()->hasPermissionTo('view [resource]') ||
           auth()->user()->hasPermissionTo('manage [resource]');
}
```

### Policy-Based Security
- **EtudiantPolicy** - Student data protection
- **EnseignantPolicy** - Teacher information security
- **ClassePolicy** - Class access control
- **EvaluationPolicy** - Evaluation management security
- **NotePolicy** - Grade data protection

### Middleware Protection
Updated `EnsureAdminRole` middleware allows appropriate role access:
```php
auth()->user()->hasAnyRole([
    'super_admin', 'admin', 'director', 
    'academic_coordinator', 'secretary', 
    'teacher', 'accountant'
])
```
